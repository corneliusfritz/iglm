\format{
The \code{iglm.data} provides the following information:
\describe{
  \item{z_network}{A \eqn{E \times 2} integer matrix representing the 
    undirected friendship network ($Z$).}
  \item{x_attribute}{A logical/binomial vector of length \eqn{N} indicating 
    gender (1 for female, 0 for male).}
  \item{y_attribute}{A numeric vector of length \eqn{N} representing the 
    log-transformed total call duration in minutes: 
    \eqn{y_i = \log(\frac{\text{seconds}}{60})}.}
  \item{neighborhood}{A matrix defining the proximity-based constraint 
    space. Pairs are included if their cumulative 
    physical proximity exceeded 24 hours during the observation period.}
  \item{fix_x}{Boolean \code{TRUE}, indicating that the \eqn{x} attribute 
    is treated as exogenous.}
}
}

\description{
A preprocessed dataset containing social ties, physical proximity, and nodal 
attributes for a subset of participants in the Copenhagen Networks Study. 
The object is provided as an \code{iglm.data} class.
}
\details{
The following preprocessing steps were carried out:

\itemize{
  \item \bold{Temporal Aggregation:} Proximity data (Bluetooth scans) 
    were aggregated into sessions. A session break was defined by any 
    temporal gap exceeding 10 minutes.
  \item \bold{Recursive Pruning:} A recursive filter removed actors with missing 
    gender information or isolated actors in either the 
    friendship (\code{z_network}) or proximity (\code{neighborhood}) networks,
