\title{Compute Statistics}
\usage{
count_statistics(formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A model `formula` object. The left-hand side should be the
name of a \code{\link{netplus}} object available in the calling environment. 
See \code{\link{model_terms}} for details on specifying the right-hand side terms.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector. Each element corresponds to a term in the
  `formula`, and its value is the calculated observed feature
  for that term based on the data in the \code{\link{netplus}} object. The names of the
  vector match the coefficient names derived from the formula terms.
}
\description{
Computes statistics.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple netplus object
n_actors = 10
neighborhood = matrix(1, nrow = n_actors, ncol = n_actors)
type_x <- "binomial"
type_y <- "binomial"
object = netplus(neighborhood = neighborhood, directed = FALSE, type_x = type_y, type_y = type_y)
count_statistics(object ~ edges(mode = "local") + attribute_y + attribute_x)
}
