\usage{
iglm(
  formula = NULL,
  coef = NULL,
  coef_degrees = NULL,
  sampler = NULL,
  control = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A model `formula` object. The left-hand side should be the
name of a `iglm.data` object available in the calling environment. 
See \code{\link{model.terms}} for details on specifying the right-hand side terms.}

\item{coef}{Optional numeric vector of initial coefficients for the structural
(non-degrees) terms in `formula`. If `NULL`, coefficients are
initialized to zero. Length must match the number of terms.}

\item{coef_degrees}{Optional numeric vector specifying the initial degrees
coefficients. Required if `formula` includes degrees terms, otherwise
should be `NULL`. Length must match `n_actor` (for undirected) or
`2 * n_actor` (for directed).}

\item{sampler}{An object of class \code{\link{sampler.iglm}}, controlling the MCMC sampling scheme. If `NULL`,
default sampler settings will be used.}

\item{control}{An object of class \code{\link{control.iglm}}, specifying parameters for the estimation algorithm.
If `NULL`, default control settings will be used.}

\item{name}{Optional character string specifying a name for the model.}

\item{file}{Optional character string specifying a file path to load a
previously saved  \code{\link{iglm.object}} from disk (in RDS format). If provided,
other arguments are ignored and the object is loaded from the file.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{iglm.object}}.

\description{
\code{R} package \code{iglm} implements generalized linear models (GLMs) 
for studying relationships among attributes in connected populations, 
where responses of connected units can be dependent.
It extends GLMs for independent responses to dependent responses and can 
be used for studying spillover in connected populations and other network-mediated phenomena.
It is based on a joint probability model for dependent 
responses (\eqn{Y}) and connections \eqn{(Z)} conditional on 
predictors (X).
}
\section{Model Formulation}{
 

The joint probability density is specified as
\deqn{f_{\theta}(y,z,x) \propto \Big[\prod_{i=1}^{N} a_x(x_i)\, a_y(y_i) \exp(\theta_g^T \mathbf{g}_i(x_i^*, y_i^*)) \Big] \times  
\Big[\prod_{i \ne j} a_z(z_{i,j}) \exp(\theta_h^T \mathbf{h}_{i,j}(x_i^*,x_j^*, y_i^*, y_j^*, z)) \Big],}
which is defined by two distinct sets of user-specified features:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{\eqn{\mathbf{g}_i(x_i^*, y_i^*)= (g_i(x_i^*, y_i^*))}}: A vector of unit-level functions (or "g-terms")
    that describe the relationship between an individual actor \eqn{i}'s
    predictors (\eqn{x_i}) and their own response (\eqn{y_i}).
  \item \strong{\eqn{\mathbf{h}_{i,j}(x_i^*,x_j^*, y_i^*, y_j^*, z)= (h_{i,j}(x_i^*,x_j^*, y_i^*, y_j^*, z))}}: A vector of pair-level functions (or "h-terms")
    that specify how the connections (\eqn{z}) and responses (\eqn{y_i, y_j})
    of a pair of units \eqn{\{i,j\}} depend on each other and the wider 
    network structure.
}

This separation allows the model to simultaneously capture individual-level
behavior (via \eqn{g_i}) and dyadic, network-based dependencies (via \eqn{h_{i,j}}), 
including local dependence limited to overlapping neighborhoods.
This help page documents the various statistics available in 'iglm',
corresponding to the \eqn{g_i} (attribute-level) and \eqn{h_{i,j}} (pair-level)
components of the joint model. See \code{\link{model.terms}} for details on specifying 
all model terms via the formula interface.
