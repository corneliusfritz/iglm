\title{Model specification for a `iglm' object}
\description{
The help pages of \code{\link{iglm}} describe the model with details on model fitting
and estimation.
Generally, a model is specified via it's sufficient statistics, 
that can be further decomposed into two parts: 
\itemize{
  \item \strong{\eqn{\mathbf{g}_i(x_i^*,y_i^*) = \mathbf{g}_i(x_i,y_i)= (g_i(x_i,y_i))}}: A vector of unit-level functions (or "g-terms")
    that describe the relationship between an individual actor \eqn{i}'s
    predictors (\eqn{x_i}) and their own response (\eqn{y_i}).
  \item \strong{\eqn{\mathbf{h}_{i,j}(x_i^*,x_j^*, y_i^*, y_j^*, z) = \mathbf{h}_{i,j}(x,y,z)= (h_{i,j}(x,y,z))}}: A vector of pair-level functions (or "h-terms")
    that specify how the connections (\eqn{z}) and responses (\eqn{y_i, y_j})
    of a pair of units \eqn{\{i,j\}} depend on each other and the wider 
    network structure.
}
Each term defines a component for the model's features, which
are a sum of unit-level components, \eqn{\sum_i g_i(x_i,y_i)}, and/or
pair-level components, \eqn{\sum_{i \ne j} h_{i,j}(x,y,z)}.
The implemented terms are grouped into three categories:
\enumerate{
\item  \eqn{{g}_i} terms for attribute dependence,
\item \eqn{{h}_{i,j}} terms for network dependence,
\item \eqn{{h}_{i,j}} Terms for joint attribute/network dependence.
}
Below is a detailed description of each term that can be specified in the model formula (see, \code{\link{iglm}}):
\code{iglm.data ~ <term_1> + <term_2> + ... }, where the left-hand side of the formula has to be a \code{\link{iglm.data}} object,
and the right-hand side lists some of the terms from the list below, which should be included in the model.
Setting, e.g., \code{<term_1>} to  \code{attribute_x} includes the term \eqn{g_i(x,y,z) = x_i} in \eqn{g_i}. 
Note that the function \code{\link{create_userterms_skeleton}} can be used to create custom terms.
}
\section{Notation}{
 

Here, \eqn{x_i} and \eqn{y_i} are the attributes for actor \eqn{i},
and \eqn{z_{i,j}} indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a tie
from actor \eqn{i} to actor \eqn{j}.
The local neighborhood of actor \eqn{i} is denoted \eqn{\mathcal{N}_i},
and the indicator for whether actors \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} share a local
neighborhood is given by
\eqn{c_{i,j} = \mathbb{I}(\mathcal{N}_i \cap \mathcal{N}_j \neq \emptyset)}.
The functions below specify the forms of \eqn{g_i(x_i,y_i)} and \eqn{h_{i,j}(x,y,z)}
for each term.
Some terms also depend on other covariates, which are denoted by
\eqn{v = (v_1, ..., v_N)} (unit-level) and \eqn{w = (w_{i,j}) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}}(dyadic). 
These covariates must be provided by the user via the \code{data} argument of the terms. 
Assuming that the matriv \code{x} exists in the environment associated with the 
used formula, \code{cov_z(data = v)} includes the dyadic covariable \eqn{v = (v_{i,j})} in the model. 
Some terms also have a \code{mode} argument, which can take values
\code{"global"}, \code{"local"}, or \code{"alocal"}.
The \code{"global"} mode indicates that the statistic is computed
over the entire network, while \code{"local"} restricts the statistic
to local neighborhoods only (i.e., edges where \eqn{c_{i,j} = 1}).
The \code{"alocal"} mode restricts the statistic to non-local edges
only (i.e., edges where \eqn{c_{i,j} = 0}).
For instance, \code{edges(mode = "local")} counts the number of edges
that connect actors with overlapping neighborhoods. 
See underneath for which options are implemented for each term.
See the documentation for \code{\link{iglm}} for details on model fitting
and estimation.
