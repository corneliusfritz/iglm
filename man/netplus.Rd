netplus(
  x_attribute = NULL,
  y_attribute = NULL,
  z_network = NULL,
  neighborhood = NULL,
  directed = NA,
  n_actor = NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{x_attribute}{A numeric vector for the first unit-level attribute.}

\item{y_attribute}{A numeric vector for the second unit-level attribute.}

\item{z_network}{A matrix representing the network. Can be a 2-column
edgelist or a square adjacency matrix.}

\item{neighborhood}{An optional matrix for the neighborhood representing local dependence.
Can be a 2-column edgelist or a square adjacency matrix. 
A tie in `neighborhood` between actor i and j indicates that j is in the neighborhood of i, 
implying dependence between the respective actors.}

\item{directed}{A logical value indicating if `z_network` is directed.
If `NA` (default), directedness is inferred from the symmetry of
`z_network`.}

\item{n_actor}{An integer for the number of actors in the system.
If `NA` (default), `n_actor` is inferred from the attributes or
network matrices.}

\item{type_x}{Character string for the type of `x_attribute`.
Must be one of `"binomial"`, `"poisson"`, or `"normal"`.
Default is `"binomial"`.}

\item{type_y}{Character string for the type of `y_attribute`.
Must be one of `"binomial"`, `"poisson"`, or `"normal"`.
Default is `"binomial"`.}

\item{scale_x}{A positive numeric value for scaling (e.g., variance
for "normal" type). Default is 1.}

\item{scale_y}{A positive numeric value for scaling (e.g., variance
for "normal" type). Default is 1.}

\item{return_neighborhood}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default) and
`neighborhood` is `NULL`, a full neighborhood (all dyads) is
generated implying global dependence. If `FALSE`, no neighborhood is set.}

\item{file}{(character) Optional file path to load a saved `netplus` object state.}
}
\value{
An object of class `netplus` (and `R6`).
}
\description{
Creates a `netplus` object, which stores network and attribute data.
This function acts as a user-friendly interface to the `netplus` R6 class generator.
It handles data input, infers parameters like the number of actors (`n_actor`)
and network directedness (`directed`) if not explicitly provided, processes
network data into a consistent edgelist format, calculates the overlap
relation based on an optional neighborhood definition, and performs
extensive validation of all inputs.
